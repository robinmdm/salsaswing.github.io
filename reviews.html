    <h4>Michaela Johnson</h4>
    <blockquote>
      I had a terrific experience, and the instructor was really kind,
      enjoyable, and inspiring. Very tidy studio that is unquestionably safe for
      video.

    <h4>Kevin Spacey</h4>
    <blockquote>
      I've been to a lot of dance studios, but this one has the friendliest
      personnel, the most lovely and peaceful setting, and enormous windows that
      let in a ton of lovely light! Would without a doubt suggest the classes!

    <h4>Nicolas Cage</h4>
    <blockquote>
      It's a great location for dancing instruction. Come for the socials and
      dance the night away while fostering a sense of community. They offer
      classes for all skill levels, from complete beginners to experts.

    <h4>Denzel Washington</h4>
    <blockquote>
      I had a fun while I was there for a dance party. There are so many amazing
      people there that I will keep going and learn other dances. Additionally
      friendly is the staff. I would strongly recommend going if you haven't
      already.
