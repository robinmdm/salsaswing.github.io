    <p>
      The beginner salsa dance enthusiast's journey begins with this five-week
      session. No prior dance training is required or anticipated. Both male and
      female students will learn the basic concepts of partnering, dance floor
      manners, timing, fundamental footwork, full and half turns, "cross body
      lead," and practical salsa dancing patterns in these dance sessions.

    <p>
      This class is designed exclusively for our youngest dancers. It is best
      suited to keep the interest of our little dancers because it is only a
      half-hour long and is quite entertaining. Playing entertaining Irish dance
      games with friends helps us learn our reel, fundamental dancing skills,
      and how to count to the music. Who could not love this? Tiny tots will
      enjoy making new friends while learning coordination, balance,
      collaboration, and musicality in this class.

    <!-- Hip Hop -->

    <p>
      Hip hop has a LARGE amount of performance. In addition to seeing dancers
      learn and perform the choreography, we also want to watch them perform for
      and amuse their audience on stage and in class. At all times in class,
      unless otherwise instructed, we anticipate seeing dancers giving it their
      all.

    <!-- Charleston -->

    <p><a href="charleston.html">Charleston</a></p>
    <p>
      Our vivacious and energizing Charleston Dance Classes will expose you to
      the hot jazz sounds of the Charleston and have you moving with speed,
      vitality, and expression. They are suitable for total beginners as well as
      the more experienced Swing or Jive Dancer. For you to suit around your
      schedule, we provide both one-time workshops and four-week short courses.
    </p>

    <!-- Swing -->

    <p><a href="swing.html">Swing</a></p>
    <p>
      In addition to being well-liked, swing dancing is also one of the easiest
      and most adaptable dances to master. You will learn both West Coast Swing,
      a modern dance for a variety of music from Michael Jackson to hip hop,
      pop, and R&B, and East Coast Swing (also known as Jitterbug), danced to
      Big Band, Swing, and Rock n' Roll.
