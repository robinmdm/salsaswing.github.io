    <!-- 3rd FAQ -->
    <details>
      <summary>What should I wear for class?</summary>
      <div>
        Dance is about having fun and moving. We advise that you dress
        comfortably so that you can move around freely. <br />

        For your first lesson, you can dress whichever you like. After that, we
        will make a recommendation depending on the direction and style you
        select. <br />

        Stilettos and other footwear with pointed heels should be avoided as
        they are uncomfortable for dancing in and could harm our floor.

    <!-- 4th FAQ -->
    <details>
      <summary>Do I need dance shoes?</summary>
      <div>
        Although not essential, dance shoes are advised. However, we do not
        recommend that you wear rubber-soled shoes so that you can move around
        the floor easily. <br />

        Shoes with metal bottoms or sharp heels are strongly discouraged since
        they could hurt someone or damage the floor.
