      <!-- 3rd FAQ -->
      <details>
        <summary>What should I wear for class?</summary>
        <div>
          Dance is about having fun and moving. We advise that you dress
          comfortably so that you can move around freely. <br />

          For your first lesson, you can dress whichever you like. After that,
          we will make a recommendation depending on the direction and style you
          select. <br />

          Stilettos and other footwear with pointed heels should be avoided as
          they are uncomfortable for dancing in and could harm our floor.

      </details>

      <!-- 4th FAQ -->
      <details>
        <summary>Do I need dance shoes?</summary>
        <div>
          Although not essential, dance shoes are advised. However, we do not
          recommend that you wear rubber-soled shoes so that you can move around
          the floor easily. <br />

          Shoes with metal bottoms or sharp heels are strongly discouraged since
          they could hurt someone or damage the floor.
